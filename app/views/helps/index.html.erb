                                    Ask Nepal helps you find information about the Nepal government and its public bodies. Ask Nepal helps access information about local government, central government, parliament, state funded schools, universities, hospitals and other public authorities.

                                    Government in Nepal impacts your life in many ways. The quality of roads, hospitals, schools, our environment, or the government's ability to supply electricity affects our lives. There are some things government in Nepal is doing well and there are some areas where it struggles to provide better services.

                                    The more you know about your government, the better you will be able to make suggestions to improve the things that Nepal government struggles to do well. This website also helps many journalists, students, and professionals as they do their research.
